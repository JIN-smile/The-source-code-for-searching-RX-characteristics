**`Title`**：On the Eﬀect of the Key Expansion Algorithm in Simon-like ciphers  
**`Author`**: Jinyu Lu, Yunwen Liu, Tomer Ashur and Chao Li   
**`Abstract`**：In this work we investigate how the choice of the key expansion algorithm and its interaction with the round function aﬀect the resistance of Simon-like ciphers against RX-cryptanalysis. We observe that among the key expansion algorithms we consider, Simon’s is most resistant, while Simeck’s is much less so. Implications on lightweight ciphers’ design are discussed and open questions are proposed.
