**`Title`**：On the Eﬀect of the Key-expansion Algorithm in Simon-like ciphers  
**`Author`**: Jinyu Lu, Yunwen Liu, Tomer Ashur and Chao Li   
**`Abstract`**：In this work we investigate how the choice of the key-expansion algorithm and its interaction with the round function affect the resistance of Simon-like ciphers
against rotational-XOR (RX) cryptanalysis. We observe that among the key-expansion algorithms we consider, Simon is most resistant, while Simeck is much less so. Implications on lightweight ciphers design are discussed and open questions are proposed.
